# Rust syntax scanner third-party notices

The `atlas-rust-syntax` executable statically links Rust crates recorded in
`Cargo.lock`. The direct parser/runtime dependencies are:

- tree-sitter 0.27.0 and tree-sitter-rust 0.24.2 — MIT License;
- syn 3.0.6, serde 1.0.229, and serde_json 1.0.151 — MIT OR Apache-2.0.

Their transitive Rust dependencies use MIT, Apache-2.0, Unlicense, dual
MIT/Apache-2.0 terms, and (for `unicode-ident`) Unicode-3.0 together with
MIT or Apache-2.0. Atlas selects the MIT option where the upstream offers it.
Exact versions are preserved in the bundle manifest by the SHA-256 of
`Cargo.lock`. Source and license metadata are available from the corresponding
crates at <https://crates.io/>.
